## Kinda Sciency

Hello my name is Dusti and I welcome to my blog *Kinda Sciency*.

I'm on a quest to simplify my life in 66 days.  Yup, to go on a journey of decluttering my life in about a two months timeframe.

Sounds fun right?

Maybe...

Here's a little of the back story to paint the scene and I hope you tag along as I keep track of my progress.

I've always loved to improve myself and work to achieve a more productive state of being.  This mindset was always accompanied with the goal to obtain more by being smarter, working harder, and preparing to be more and gain more.  I spent lots of time reading and learning how to become the best person that I could possibly be in our ever competative society.

Can you guess what happened?  I sorta burned out after a while of trying, trying, trying, and essentially failing now and again.  I seemed to think that failure was a sign to I simply wasn't getting it, so I'd try harder...

I finally had an ephiany one Saturday while simultaneously completing two tasks on my seemingly endless checklist of tasks.  I was listening to Greg McKeown's book *[Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism)*.  In it he described to idea of a disciplined approach to chosing to do less to get more and enstead focus on fewer things for a better happier output.
