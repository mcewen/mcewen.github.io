I'm on a quest to simplify my life in 66 days.  Yup, to go on a journey of decluttering my life in about a two months timeframe.

Sounds fun right?

Maybe...

Here's a little of the back story to paint the scene and I hope you tag along as I keep track of my progress.

I've always loved to improve myself and work to achieve a more productive state of being.  This mindset was always accompanied with the goal to obtain more by being smarter, working harder, and preparing to be more and gain more.  I spent lots of time reading and learning how to become the best person that I could possibly be in our ever competative society.

Can you guess what happened?  I sorta burned out after a while of trying, trying, trying, and essentially failing now and again.  I seemed to think that failure was a sign to I simply wasn't getting it, so I'd try harder...

I finally had an ephiany one Saturday while simultaneously completing two tasks on my seemingly endless checklist of tasks.  I was listening to Greg McKeown's book *[Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism)*.  In it he described to idea of 
>“Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.”
